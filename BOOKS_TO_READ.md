## The Two People to Study

| Person | Why | What You Learn |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| **Bernard Arnault** | Built LVMH. Richest man on earth. Understands luxury, scarcity, and premium better than anyone alive. | Why you never discount. Why scarcity is real. Why "not for everyone" prints money. The long game. |
| **Alex Hormozi** | Went from $0 to $100M+ exits. Most practical mind on offers, pricing, and value. No theory — just what works. | How to structure offers. How to price. How to make the value so obvious the price becomes irrelevant. |

**Arnault** teaches you *who to be*.
**Hormozi** teaches you *what to do*.
